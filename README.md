# Python_ID3

Implementation of machine learning ID3 algorithm in python. Algorithm builds a decision tree to classify each animal in dataset.

First decision tree is build based on all the rows in dataset. Then algorithm learns only on 90% of samples as training set and tests the algorithm on other 10%. Average precision of the algorithm is shown at the end along with its standard deviation.

Project was co-created with Weronika GÃ³recka (https://github.com/wgorecka).
